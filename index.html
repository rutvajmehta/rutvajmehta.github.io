            <p class="bio"> I am a computer science major. I absolutely love burritos. It got a little out of hand when I used burritos as my currency as a child. (The "exchange rate" was $8 = 1 burrito.) I also really enjoy reading and find it to be very calming.

          <h2>The Algorithmic Lens</h2>
          <p class="description">Dive deep into the unseen territories of the internet with "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/aditya-singh-671411736/engl-podcast" target="_blank">The Algorithmic Lens</a>" where hosts Amisha, Alex, and Rutva unravel the intricate web of echo chambers and filter bubbles that silently shape our views and beliefs. In a world dominated by social media, we explore how algorithms reinforce our pre-existing biases, creating a skewed version of reality that can fuel fringe movements, polarize communities, and spread misinformation. From the Anti-Vax movement to political manipulation, we dissect real-life implications and question the role of tech giants in this digital manipulation. Don't miss this eye-opening journey into understanding and overcoming the hidden forces that influence our digital lives.</p>

          <h2>Rice Cooker Meals on a Budget</h2>
          <p class="description"> I watched a couple videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uME9lS7JJzE">Rice Cooker Meals on a College Student Budget</a> when I first came to Virginia Tech and I found that it wasn't the best for me so I modified a couple things and found what worked for me time wise and financially. </p>
